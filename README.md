# Age_progression-regression
Here I show an implementation of the CAAE(Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder) proposed in Age Progression/Regression by Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder by  Zhifei Zhang∗ , Yang Song∗ , Hairong Qi The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA

Note: This implementation is not exactly the same as proposed in the paper as things like tv loss and batch size are omitted and different respectively. But overall all the networks i.e encoder, generator, discriminator are built to my understanding of the descriptions of the paper and it achieves good image generation. Also I didn't train the encoder with a discriminator as proposed in the paper due to computational limitations.

Dataset used: UTKFace dataset.
